    "- Basel II impact: Requires interpretable, auditable models and strong documentation for capital and supervisory review.\n",
    "- Proxy target: We use RFM-based proxy labels because true default labels are unavailable; this enables model development but introduces proxy risk and potential bias — monitor, validate, and retrain when real defaults arrive.\n",
    "- Model trade-offs: Use Logistic Regression with WoE for production explainability and regulatory compliance; use Gradient Boosting as a validation/benchmark model to detect additional signal and interactions.\n",
    "- Action items: Monitor proxy alignment, implement conservative thresholds and appeals, collect real default outcomes for retraining, and maintain MLflow audit trails."
