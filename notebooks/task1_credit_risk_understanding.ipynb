    "1. **Basel II & Interpretability:** Why must our scoring pipeline stay explainable and auditable (capital allocation, supervisory review, disclosure)?\n",
    "2. **Proxy Target Risks:** Without ground-truth defaults, what governs proxy creation, monitoring drift, and communicating limitations?\n",
    "3. **Model Trade-offs:** When is WoE+LogReg preferable to Gradient Boosting despite accuracy gains? Consider governance, fairness, and ops costs."

    "1. Re-run Logistic Regression with `class_weight='balanced'` and monitor convergence warnings.\n",
    "2. Introduce stratified splits or cross-validation for Random Forest plus real default labels when available.\n",
    "3. Promote the MLflow runs to README and dashboards (done) and keep the metadata handy for Task 2–4 notebooks."
